   == Background Information

   === Overview

   {description}

   This chapter provides background and general information about M5, guidance about this specification,
   and instructions for using M5.


   === About this Specification

   This document covers the M5 language as well as its standard <<Macro Library>>. This document's major
   version reflects the language version, and the minor version reflects the library version. There is
   also a document subversion distinguishing versions of this document with no corresponding language or
   library changes.


   === M5's Origin Story

   I created M5 as a preprocessor for the https://tl-x.org[TL-Verilog] hardware
   language and later decoupled it as a stand-alone tool. The original intent was to use
   an out-of-the box macro preprocessor to provide a stop-gap solutions to missing TL-Verilog language
   features for "code construction" as TL-Verilog took shape. While other hardware languages build on existing
   programming languages to provide code construction, I wanted a simpler approach that would be less
   intimidating to hardware folks. M4 was the obvious choice as the most broadly adopted macro preprocessor.
   
   M4 proved to be capable, but extremely difficult to work with. After a few years
   fighting with an approach that was intended to allow me to focus my attention elsewhere, I
   decided I needed to either find a different approach or clean up the one I had. I felt my struggles
   had led to some worthwhile insights and that there was a place in the
   world for a better text processing language/tool, so I carved out some time to polish my mountain of hacks.

   Though M5 would benefit from a fresh non-M4/Perl-based implementation, I had to draw the line somewhere.
   At this point, that legacy is mostly behind the scenes, and while it's not everything I'd like it to be,
   it's close, and it's way better than any other text preprocessor I'm aware of.

   So I hope you enjoy the language I never wanted to write. I'm actually rather proud of it and find new uses
   for it every day.


   [[vs_m4]]
   === M5 Versus M4

   M5 uses M4 to implement a text-preprocessing language with some subtle philosophical
   differences. M5 aims to preserve most of the conceptual simplicity of
   macro preprocessing while adding features that improve readability, manageability, and
   debuggability for more complex use cases.

   This document is intended to stand on its own, independent of the
   https://www.gnu.org/software/m4/[M4 documentation]. The M4 documentation
   can, in fact, be confusing due to M5's philosophical differences with M4.

   Beyond M4, M5 contributes:

   - features that feel like a typical, simple programming language
   - literal string variables
   - functions with named arguments
   - variable/macro scope
   - an intentionally minimal amount of syntactic sugar
   - document generation assistance
   - debug aids such as stack traces
   - safer parsing and string manipulation
   - a richer core library of utilities
   - a future plan for modular libraries

   === Limitations of M5

   M4 has certain limitations that M5 is unable to address. M5 uses M4 as is without
   modifications to the M4 implementation (though these limitations may motivate
   changes to M4 in the future).

   ==== Security
   M4 has full access to its host environment (similar to most programming and scripting
   languages, but unlike many macro preprocessors). Malware can easily do harm. Third-
   party M5 code should be carefully vetted before use, or M5 should be run within a contained
   environment. M5 provides a simple mechanism for library inclusion by URL (or it will).
   This enables easy execution of public third-party code, so use it with extreme caution.

   ==== Modularity
   M4 does not provide any library, namespace, and version management facilities.
   Though M5 does not currently address these needs, plans have been sketched in code comments.

   ==== String processing
   While macro processing is all about string processing, safely manipulating arbitrary
   strings is not possible in M4 or it is beyond awkward at best. M4 provides
   `m4_regexp`, `m4_patsubst`, and `m4_substr`. These return unquoted strings that will
   necessarily be elaborated, potentially altering the string. While M5 is able to jump
   through hoops to provide <<m_regex>> and <<m_substr>> (for strings of limited length)
   that return quoted (literal) text, `m4_patsubst` cannot be fixed (though <<m_for_each_regex>>
   is similar). The result of `m4_patsubst` can be quoted only by quoting the input string,
   which can complicate the match expression, or by ensuring that all text is matched,
   which can be awkward, and quoting substitutions.

   In addition to these issues, care must be taken to ensure that resulting text does not contain mismatching
   quotes or parentheses or combine with surrounding text to result in the same. Such
   resulting mismatches are difficult to debug. M5 provides a notion of "unquoted strings"
   that can be safely manipulated using <<m_regex>>, and <<m_substr>>.

   Additionally the regex configuration used by M4 is quite dated. For example, it does
   not support lookahead, lazy matches, and character codes.

   ==== Introspection
   Introspection is essentially impossible. The only way to see what is defined is to
   dump definitions to a file and parse this file.

   ==== Recursion
   Recursion has a fixed (command-line) depth limit, and this limit is not applied reliably.

   ==== Unicode
   M4 is an old tool and was built for ASCII text. UTF-8 is now the most common text format.
   It is a superset of ASCII that encodes additional characters as two or more bytes using byte
   codes (0x10-0xFF) that do not conflict by those defined by ASCII (0x00-0x7F). All such bytes
   (0x10-0xFF) are treated as characters by M4 with no special meaning, so these characters
   pass through, unaffected, in macro processing like most others. There are two
   implications to be aware of. First, <<m_length>> provides a length in bytes, not characters.
   Second, <<m_substr>> and regular expressions manipulate bytes, not characters. This can
   result in text being split in the mid-character, resulting in invalid character
   encodings.

   ==== Debugging features
   M4's facilities for associating output with input only map output lines to line numbers of
   top-level calls. M4 does not maintain a call stack with line numbers.

   M4 and M5 have no debugger to step through code. Printing (see <<m_DEBUG>> is the debugging mechanism of choice.

   ==== Performance
   M5 is intended for text processing, not for compute-intensive algorithms. Use a programming
   language for that.

   ==== Graphics
   M5 is for text processing only.

   ==== Status

   Major next steps include:

   - Implementing a better library system.
   - Some syntactic sugar (quotes, code blocks) should not be recognized in source context.

   See issues file in the https://github.com/rweda/M5[M5 repository] for more details.

   /**
   ==== Futures
   - All literal text must be quoted.
   - Being more explicit about text that should evaluate and text that shouldn't might be better.
   Quote type:
     - `"` for single-line literal text (Note, there is no distinction between begin and end.)
     - `{`/`}` for single-line code (for current implementation, use `[`/`]`)
     - `<">`/`<">` for heavily quoted text that may have `\n` and `"` in it. (same begin/end)
     - All of the above followed by a newline for block versions, excluding continuation cases.
     Continuation cases return to quote and argument list context that existed at the start of
     the line, not including block termination.
   - Unquoted whitespace can be ignored!
   - There's no need for `m5_` prefix! Any unquoted text is a macro or variable instantiation.
   - Suddenly, there's no need for code context. There's just quoted context and unquoted context.
   - There's room for other unquoted syntax, like comments, though, maybe `<">  |` for line comment
   in heavy block quote context, where the ending `<">` is implied by by "\n"?? Probably not.
   - `"-` for literal quote character. There is nothing else to escape.
   - Require a prefix for "value of"? Yes, "$MyVar". Thus we can:
   - Allow unquoted text as a complete macro argument. Not all characters are permitted.
   This way, variable names and function parameters need not be quoted.
   
   All other cases are handled by ending the string and starting a new one. And, it's better for
   the escape char to follow the quote since the quote gets you into code context with controlled
   syntax. Otherwise the literal escape char would need an escape char. `-` can also be thought of
   as code syntax for continue text with added `"`. Note that heavy quotes can also be used.
   - We add "heavy block quotes" (`<">`...`<">`) to reduce the likelihood of inadvertent end quotes.
   Source context is heavily block quoted.
   - There's no escaping (`m5_\`, `\m5_`).
   - Keep "~" or drop it? Required only when beginning a line?
   - Probably still check for balanced quotes and parens. (Not for constructed code.)
   - Anything to enforce consistent formatting (like in code blocks)? Probably worth it.
   - Allow unquoted numbers. Text that starts with a digit is automatically quoted till the end
   of the word. C-style numbers.
   - Support operators and () in unquoted context for arithmetic? Operators work on text (like
   everything, and that text must represent numbers). Could do full order of operations, only left-
   to-right, or only two operands with nesting, e.g. "((1 + Val) * 3)".
   - No `$1` syntax in the language itself, but this can be supported by a `macro` macro. `arg(2)`
   would call a builtin to access arg 2. Provide other builtins for special M4 `$` syntax.
   - eval("foo(1, 2)") is fine.
   - foo() has zero args; foo("") has one?
   - But... <">MyVar<"> is clunky. Maybe for heavy text we keep `m5_`/`\m5_` as an/the escape and
   `///`/`/**` for comments??? Maybe just a special case for variables. Needs regex configurability.
   (Post-string substitutions can be performed by wrapping the heavy string in a macro call.)
   - We need to use `~` for something so we can call the language Tilda and give files a `~` extension,
   like `model.tlv~`. Two-line make code to preprocess and run.

   Example:

    Source... blah, blah, blah.<"> # comment <"> Then,
    blah, blah, blah.<">     | line comment?
    etc.
    <">

    set(Me, "Steve")
    
    fn(foo, f:{   # f is a label
      "text"
      if(1 || $Cnt, {
        hi()" more text"
      })
      "Hey, "$Player"!"
      if_eq($Val, 2, {hi()"."})
      # A text block with explicit indentation.
      chomp(
         "
         Here's a line of text as a block.
      ".)   # "." includes a newline at the end of the block without an extra line.
      
      fn(Hi, {
        "Hi,"f:Me"."   # Me in f: context.
        on_return(<{>set(greeting, {pad("Hi"<}>$ArgList<{>"!")})<}>)
      })
    })<">
    ...and on we go.
   
   
   ==== Implementation Plan

   Extending Perl `pre_m4` to get most of the benefit (though less simplification to docs):
   - Keep code block `{` and `[` as they are.
   - Keep text blocks as they are.
   - Keep `<label>` as it is.
   - Keep `~` as it is.
   - Add support for `"`.
   - Add a prefix char equivalent to `m5_`. Say "\`"?
   - Add pragma that enables new behavior for unquoted text:
     - Auto-apply `m5_` prefixes.
     - Report an error for unquoted text.
     - Auto-quote numbers.
   - Also enable new behavior once a `"` is encountered.

   Incremental step toward non-M4 solution:
   - Keep M4 as the back-end, but write a new pre_m4 (by a new name) in Python(?) that produces compatible M4 output.
   - Enter quoted context by default. (Not required to re-enter to end file.)
   - Auto-apply `m5_`.
   - Let `m5_eval` retain its old behavior.
   - Write a new pre_m4 in Python (or stick w/ Perl, but... nah).
   - Need to convert current .m5 files.
   
   Clean rewrite:
   - Start from Python parser above.
   - Implement macro calls
     - Assign builtins for accessing args.
   - Implement builtin macros:
     - macro behind `var`/`macro`
     - math
     - regex
     - string manipulation
     - etc. (similar to M4 builtins)
   - Add position tracking and call stacks.


   ==== M6 (Work this in above)

   M6 would be rebuilt from scratch without the use of M4.
   - m6() has 0 args; m6(['']) has 1 arg; m6(m6_shift(1)) has 0 args.
   - No $ substitution if no arg list. In fact definitions should be distinct between vars and macros, so
   it's always one use or the other.
   - No @*
   - `m6_` and quote chars are configurable as an attribute of quoted text or file as a whole. (If still M4 under the hood, `pre_m6`
   would substitute it for a control character prefix, and M4 would be configured to recognize
   this control character as a word.)
   - No inline behavior of macros (`['']`) implied after macro definitions.
   - Many of the M4 macros that return unquoted text would return quoted text, and other <<Limitations_of_M5>>
   would be fixed as well.
   - All m6_... are interpreted as a call; error reported if macro doesn't exist.
   - Source tracking:
     - The macro (not just function) call stack can be maintained. The text produced by each macro can
     be associated with the macro call that produced it (in a nested fashion). (And each called macro can
     have an associate source location.)
     - M6 can maintain source tracking on all strings, identifying its position in the source file. This is
     the leaf level of the previous bullet.
     - This can lead to very useful interactive debug IDE features that associate output with source.
   - A debugger would be awesome. Within the debugger, all strings would have associated source/stack
   information.
   - To assist with (language-dependent) source tracking, provide a hook responsible for echoing each
   outputted piece of atomic text that is given its source line number, the number of lines (carriage
   returns) in the text (or end line number), and the call stack, as well as those of the previous text.

   /** This is a bit overstated. So we get rid of ternary vs. if. Big whoop.
   === A Quick Taste

   ...

   The same conditional macros can be applied to output text, strings, statements, and expressions, so there is less
   syntax and fewer keywords to learn. Here we use the `if` (also referenced as <<m_if>>) macro in various contexts and compare
   with a more traditional programming language syntax. `if`

   Inline conditional text:

    There are m5_if(m5_BallCnt < 0, ['no'], ['m5_BallCnt']) balls remaining.
   
    print("There are " + ((ball_cnt < 0) ? "no" : ball_cnt) + "balls remaining.");

   As a code statement producing output text:

    ~if(m5_BallCnt < 0, ['no'], ['m5_BallCnt'])

    print((ball_cnt < 0) ? "no" : ball_cnt);
   
   or
   
    out_str = out_str + ((ball_cnt < 0) ? "no" : ball_cnt);

   As conditional execution:

    if(m5_BallCnt < 0, [
       set(BallCnt, 0)
    ])
   
    if (ball_cnt < 0) {
       ball_cnt = 0;
    }

   As a conditional assignment:

    ~set(BallCnt, m5_if(m5_BallCnt < 0, ['0'], ['m5_BallCnt'])
   
    ball_cnt = (ball_cnt < 0) ? 0 : ball_cnt;

   ...
   **/


   [[usage]]
   == Getting Started with the M5 Tool

   [[config]]
   === Configuring M5

   M5 adds a minimal amount of syntax, and it is important that this syntax is unlikely to conflict
   with the target language syntax. The syntax that could conflict is listed in <<Ensure No Impact>>.
   Currently, there is no easy mechanisms to configure this syntax.


   === Running M5

   The Linux command:

   ```sh
   m5 in-file > out-file
   ```

   runs M5 in its default configuration.

   /// TODO:
   (Currently, there's a dependency on M4 and perl and no installation script.)

   /// Describe use of a magic number.
   

   === Ensure No Impact

   When enabling the use of M5 on a file, first, be sure M5 processing does nothing to the file.
   M5 should output the input text, unaltered, as long as your file contains no:

   - quotes, e.g. `['`, `']`)  _(This requirement is being removed with no quote processing in source context.)_
   - `m5_` or `m4_`
   - M5 comments, e.g. `/{empty}//`, `+/']['**+`, `+']['**/+`
   - code blocks, e.g. `[` or `{` followed by a newline or `]` or `}` beginning a line after optional whitespace
     _(This requirement is being removed with no processing in source context.)_


   === Tool Flow

   Since M5 is simply substituting text, you can do bizarre things, which can be difficult to debug.
   Understanding the tool flow can help you look one step under the hood to debug issues or understand
   how syntax is interpreted.

   M5 basically processes files in two steps:

   - Interpret syntactic sugar.
   - Run M4.

   (There is a third step as well that is very minor to undo some of the sugaring.)

   Object files are generated (run `m5 -h` for options) that expose the interpretation of M5 sugar.
   Note that quotes and commas are substituted with control characters in these files, so you will
   need an appropriate tool to view them. Your shell may recognize them as binary files and prompt you
   about viewing them, which is fine to do.



   == An Overview of M5 Concepts

   === Macro Preprocessing in General

   Macro preprocessors extend a target programming language, text format, or general text file with the ability to define
   and call (aka instantiate, invoke, expand, evaluate, or elaborate) parameterized macros that provide
   text substitutions. Macros are generally used to provide convenient shorthand for commonly-used constructs.
   A macro preprocessor processes a text file sequentially with a default behavior of passing
   the input text through as output text. When a macro name is encountered, it and its argument list are substituted
   for new text according to its definition.

   M5 provides convenient syntax for macro preprocessing as well as programatic text processing, sharing the same
   macros for each. This provides advanced text manipulation to supercharge any programming language or text file.


   === Macros Overview

   A macro that simply outputs a static text string can be defined within the source file like this:

    m5_macro(hello, Hello World!)

   The above text will substitute with an empty string but will define a macro that can be called like this:

    m5_hello()

   Resulting in:

    Hello World!

   Macros can also be parameterized. Here we define a macro that outputs a string with a single
   parameter referenced as `${empty}1`:

    m5_macro(hello, Hello $1!)

   And call it like this:

    m5_hello(World)

   Resulting in:

    Hello World!

   For more details on macro syntax, see <<Declaring Macros>>, <<Calling Macros>>, and <<Macro Arguments>>.


   === Quotes Overview

   Quotes (`['` and `']`) may be used around text to prevent substitutions. For example, to provide
   a macro whose result includes a comma, quotes are needed:

    m5_macro(hello, ['Hello, $1!'])

   Without these quotes, the comma in `Hello, $1!` would be interpreted as a macro argument separator.

   Furthermore, a second level of quotes may be needed to prevent the interpretation of the comma after
   substitution:

    m5_macro(hello, ['['Hello, $1!']'])
    m5_hello(World)

   The call substitutes with `['Hello, World!']` (actually `['Hello, World!']['']`), which elaborates to the literal text:

    Hello, World!

   For more details on quote use, see <<quotes>>.


   === Variables Overview

   Variables hold string values. They can be thought of as macros without arguments. They are defined as:

    m5_var(Hello, ['Hello, World!'])
    m5_var(Age, 23)

   And used as:
      
    m5_Hello I am m5_Age years old.

   Resulting in:
      
    Hello, World! I am 23 years old.

   Variables are always returned as literal strings, so a second level of quoting is
   not required for the definition of `Hello`.

   Variables are scoped, and by convention, scoped
   definitions are named in camel case (strictly speaking, Pascal case).

   For more details on variable use, see <<variables>> and <<variable_sugar>>.


   === Macro Stacks

   All macros and variables, are actually stacks of definitions that can be pushed and popped. (These
   stacks are frequently one entry deep.) The top definition is active, providing the replacement text when
   the macro/variable is instantiated. The others are only accessible by popping the stack.
   Pushing and popping are not generally done explicitly, but rather through scoped declarations. See <<Scoped Code Blocks>>.


   === Code Syntax Overview

   The above syntax is convenient in "source context", embedded into another language. It is clear where substitutions
   occur because all macro calls and variables are referenced with an `m5_` prefix. This syntax, however, quickly becomes
   clunky for any substantial text manipulation, requiring excessive `m5_`-prefixing.
   Additionally, it is difficult to format code readably because carriage returns and other whitespace are generally
   taken literally. This results in single-line syntax with many levels of nesting that quickly become difficult
   to follow.

   To enable code structure that looks more like a programming language, "code context" can be established
   within which code syntax is supported.

   Take for example this one-line definition in source context of an `assert` macro:

    m5_macro(assert, ['m5_if(['$1'], ['m5_error(['Failed assertion: $1.'])'])'])

   This can be written equivalently (though with a slight performance impact) as:

    m5_macro(assert, {
       if(['$1'], [
          error(['Failed assertion: $1.'])
       ])
    })

   `m5_macro(` enters "argument list context", where parentheses and brackets have special meaning.
   `{` at the end of its line enters code context, where, most notably, text does not implicitly
   pass through to the output and `m5_` is implied at the beginning of each code statement
   (beginning its line). On the final line, `}` and `)` exit these contexts

   For more details, see <<code_blocks>> and <<contexts>>.


   === Functions and Scope Overview

   M5 also provides a syntax for function declarations with named parameters. The assert macro can be
   defined as a function as:

    fn(assert, Expr, {
       if(m5_Expr, [
          error(Failed assertion: m5_Expr.)
       ])
    })

   Like any respectable programming language, `Expr`, above, is local to the function.
   Functions and other macros may produce result text (see <<Function Output Example>> and <<code_blocks>>). They may also produce
   side effects including variable declarations (see <<Aftermath>>) and STDERR output (see <<m_error>>).

   For more details on functions, see <<Functions>>. For more details on scope, see <<scope>>.


   === Function Output Example

   We can add output text to this function indicating assertion failures in the resulting text:
      
    fn(assert, Expr, {
       ~if(m5_Expr, [
          error(Failed assertion: m5_Expr.)
          ~(Failed assertion: m5_Expr.)
       ])
    })

   Statements producing output are prefixed with a tilde (`~`).


   === Libraries and Namespaces Overview

   M5 has a simple and effective import mechanism where a macro library file is simply imported by its URI
   (URL or local file). Libraries can be imported into their own namespace (though this mechanism is not
   yet implemented).

   /// For more details on libraries, see <<Libraries>>. For more details on namespaces, see <<Namespaces>>.


   === Processing Steps

   Several of the above constructs, including code blocks and statements are termed "syntactic sugar" and
   are processed in a first pass before macro substitution--yes as a pre-preprocessing step.

   M5 processing involves the following (ordered) steps:

   * Substitute quotes for single control characters.
   * Process syntactic sugar (in a single pass):
   ** Strip M5 comments.
   ** Process other syntactic sugar, including block and label syntax.
   ** Process pragmas; check indentation and quote/parenthesis matching.
   * Write the resulting file.
   * Run M4 on this file (substituting macros).


   == Sugar-Free M5 Details

   === Defining "Sugar-Free"

   M5 can be used "sugar-free". It's just a bit clunky for humans. <<Syntactic Sugar>> is recognized in the
   source file. Text that is constructed on the fly and evaluated (e.g. by <<m_eval>>) is evaluated sugar-free.


   [[quotes]]
   === Quotes

   Unwanted processing, such as macro substitution, can be avoided using quotes. By default,
   these are `['` and `']` (and a configuration mechanism is not yet available to change this).
   Like syntactic sugar, they are recognized only when they appear in a
   source file and cannot be constructed from their component characters. Quotes, however, are an essential
   part of M5, not a syntactic convenience.

   Quoted text begins with `['`. The quoted text is parsed only for `['` and `']` and ends at the corresponding `']`.
   The quoted text passes through to the resulting text, including internal matching quotes, without any
   substitutions. The outer quotes themselves are discarded.
   The end quote acts as a word boundary for subsequent text processing.

   Within quotes, intervening
   characters that would otherwise have special treatment, such as commas, parentheses, and `m5_`-prefixed
   words (after sugar processing), have no special treatment.

   Quotes can be used to delimit words. For example, the empty quotes below:

    Index['']m5_Index

   enable `m5_Index` to substitute, as would:

    ['Index']m5_Index

   (`Index\m5_Index` is a shorthand for this. See <<prefix_escapes>>.)

   Quotes can also be used to avoid the interpretation of `m5_foo` as syntactic sugar. (See <<Macro Call Sugar>>.)

   Special syntax is provided for multi-line literal quoted text. (See <<Code Blocks>>.) Outside of those
   constructs, quoted text should not contain newlines since newlines are used to format code.
   Instead, the <<m_nl>> variable (or macro) provides a literal newline character, for example:

    m5_DEBUG(['Line:']m5_nl['  ']m5_Line)


   [[variables]]
   === Variables

   A variable holds a literal text string. Variables are defined using: <<m_var>>, are reassigned using <<m_set>>,
   and are accessed using <<m_get>>. For example:

    m5_var(Foo, 5)
    m5_set(Foo, m5_calc(m5_Foo + 1))
    m5_get(Foo)   /// Yields: "6"

   Syntactic sugar provides variable access using, e.g., `m5_Foo` rather than `m5_get(Foo)`. (See <<variable_sugar>>.)


   === Declaring Macros

   Here we declare an `echo` macro.

    m5_macro(echo, ['['$1']'])

   where

    m5_echo(['Hello, World!'])

   substitutes with `['Hello, World!']`, and this elaborates as `Hello, World!`.

   /**
   [%autowidth]
   |===
   |Category |Definition |Call |Resulting Text

   |Variables
   |`m5_var(Foo, 5)`
   |`m5_Foo`
   |`5`

   |Traditional macros
   |`m5_macro(foo, ['['Arg: $1']'])`
   |`m5_foo(hi)`
   |`Arg: hi`

   |Functions
   |`m5_fn(foo, in, ['m5_out(['Arg: ']m5_in)'])`
   |`m5_foo(hi)`
   |`Arg: hi`
   |===
   **/

   The most direct way to declare a macro is with <<m_macro>>. For example:

    m5_macro(foo,
       ['['Args:$1,$2']'])

   This defines the macro body as `['Args:$1,$2']`.

   A macro call returns the body of the macro definition with numbered parameters substituted with
   the corresponding arguments. Dollar parameter substitutions are made throughout the entire body
   string regardless of the use of quotes and adjacent text. The result is then evaluated, so these macros can perform
   computations, assign variables, provide argument lists, etc. In this case, the body is quoted, so
   its resulting text is literal. For example:
   
    m5_foo(A,B)     ==> Yields: "Args:A,B"

   A few special dollar parameters are supported in addition to numbered parameters. The following
   notations are substituted:

   - `${empty}1`, `${empty}2`, etc.: These substitute with corresponding arguments.
   - `${empty}#`: The number of arguments.
   - `${empty}@`: This substitutes with a comma delimited list of the arguments, each quoted so as to be
         taken literally. So, `m5_macro(foo, ['m5_bar(${empty}@)'])` is one way to define `m5_foo(...)` to have the
         same behavior as `m5_bar(...)`.
   - `${empty}*`: This is rarely useful. It is similar to `${empty}@`, but arguments are unquoted.
   - `${empty}0`: The name of the macro itself. It can be convenient for making recursive calls
         (though see <<m_recurse>>). `${empty}0__` can also be used as a name prefix to localize a macro name
         to this macro, though this use model is discouraged. (See <<masking>>.)
         For <<Functions>>, `${empty}0` is the internal name holding the function body. It should not
         be used for recursion but can be used as a unique prefix.

   CAUTION: Macros may be declared by other macros in which case the inner macro body appears within
   the outer macro body. Numbered parameters appearing in the inner body would be substituted as
   parameters of the _outer_ body. It is generally not recommended to use numbered
   parameters for arguments of nested macros, though it is possible. For more on the topic,
   see <<block_labels>>.

   A richer declaration mechanism is provided by <<m_fn>>. (See <<Functions>>.)


   === Calling Macros

   The following illustrates a call of the macro named `foo`:

    m5_foo(hello, 5)

   NOTE: When this syntax appears in a source file, it is recognized as syntatic sugar and is processed
   to provide additional checking. Here, we specifically descibe the processing of this syntax when
   constructed from other processing, noting that syntactic sugar results in similar behavior. (See. <<Macro Call Sugar>>.)

   A well-formed M5 macro name is comprised of one or more word
   characters (`a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and `_`).

   When elaboration encounters (in unquoted text and without a preceding word character or immediately following
   another macro call) `m5_`, followed immediately by the
   well-formed name of a defined macro, followed immediately by `(` (e.g. `m5_foo(`) an argument list (see <<arguments>>) is processed,
   then the macro is "called" (or "expanded"). `$` substitutions are performed on the macro body (see <<Declaring Macros>>), the
   resulting text replaces the macro name and argument list followed by an implicit `['']` to create a word boundary,
   and elaboration is resumed from the start of this substituted text.

   Macro names should not be encountered without an argument list. Though this would result in calling the
   macro with zero arguments, it is discouraged due to the syntactic confusion with variables. Macros
   can be called with zero arguments using `m5_call(macro_name)` instead. (See <<m_call>>.)

   NOTE: Though discouraged, it is possible to define macros with names containing non-word characters.
   Such macros can only be called indirectly (e.g. `m5_call(b@d, args)`). (See <<m_call>>.)

   NOTE: In addition to `m5_` macros,
   the M4 macros from which M5 is constructed are available, prefixed by `m4_`, though their
   direct use is discouraged and this document does not describe their use. Elaboration of the string `m4_`
   should by avoided.


   [[arguments]]
   === Macro Arguments

   Macro calls pass arguments within `(` and `)` that are comma-separated.
   For each argument, preceding whitespace is not part of the argument, while postceding whitespace
   is. Specifically, the argument list begins after the unquoted `(`. Subsequent text is elaborated
   sequentially (invoking macros and interpreting quotes). The text value of the first argument begins
   at the first elaborated non-whitespace charater following the `(`. Unquoted `(` are counted as
   an argument is processed. An argument is terminated by the first unquoted and non-parenthetical
   `,` or `)` in the resulting elaborated text. A subsequent argument, similarly,
   begins with the first non-whitespace character following the `,` separator. Whitespace includes
   spaces, newlines, and tabs. An unquoted `)` ends the list.

   Some examples to illustrate preceding and postceding whitespace and nested macros:

   If, `m5_foo(A,B)` echoes its arguments to produce literal text `{A;B}`, then:
   
    m5_foo(  A,  B)          ==> Yields: "{A;B}"
    m5_foo(    ['']  A,B)    ==> Yields: "{  A;B}"
    m5_foo(  A  ,  B  )      ==> Yields: "{A  ;B  }"
    m5_foo(m5_foo(A, B), C)   ==> Yields: "{{A;B};C}"
    m5_foo(m5_foo([')'],B),C)==> Yields: "{{);B};C}"  (with a warning about unbalanced parentheses)

   Arguments can be empty text, such as `()` (one empty argument) and `(,)` (two empty arguments).
   Note that the use of quotes is prefered for clarity. For example, `([''])` and
   `([''], [''])` are identical to the previous cases.

   The above syntax does not permit macro calls with zero arguments, but `m5_call(macro_name)` can be used
   for this purpose. (See <<m_call>>.)

   Be aware that when argument lists get long, it is useful to break them up on multiple lines. The newlines
   should precede, not postcede the arguments, so they are not included in the arguments. E.g.:

    m5_foo(long-arg1,
           long-arg2)

   Notably, the closing parenthesis should *not* be on a the next line by itself. This would include the
   newline and spaces in the second argument.



   == Syntactic Sugar

   Syntactic sugar is syntax that is processed directly in the source file prior to macro processing. (See <<Processing Steps>>.)

   === Comments

   ==== M5 Comments (`/{empty}//` and `/{empty}*{empty}*`...`{empty}*{empty}*/`)

   M5 comments are one form of syntactic sugar. They look like:

    /']['// This line comment will disappear.
    /*']['* This block comment will also disappear. *']['*/

   Block comments begin with `/{empty}*{empty}*` and end with `{empty}*{empty}*/`. Line comments
   begin with `/{empty}//` and end with a newline. Both are stripped prior to any other processing.
   As such:

   - M5-commented parentheses and quotes are not visible to parenthesis and quote matching checks, etc.
   - M5 comments may follow the `[` or `{` beginning a code block or after a comma and prior to an argument
   that begins on the next line without affecting the code block or argument.

   Whitespace preceding a line comment is also stripped. Newlines from block comments are preserved.

   NOTE: Text immediately following `{empty}*{empty}*/` may, after stripping the comment, begin the line.
   Comments are stripped before indentation checking. It is thus generally recommented that multi-line block comments
   end with a newline.

   In case `/{empty}//` or `/{empty}*{empty}*` are needed in the resulting file, quotes can be used, e.g.: `['//']['/']`, to
   disrupt the syntax.


   ==== Target-Language Comments (E.g. `//`)

   Comments in the target language are not recognized as comments by M5. To disable
   M5 code, it is important to use M5 comments, not target-language comments. (Thus it can be especially
   problematic when one's editor mode highlights target-language comments in a manner that suggests the
   code has no impact.)


   [[statement_comments]]
   ==== Statement Comments (E.g. `/`)

   These are specific to <<code_blocks>>, introduced later.


   [[macro_sugar]]
   === Macro Call Sugar

   `m5_\foo(` is syntactic sugar for `m5_\call(foo,`. (See <<m_call>>.) This transformation
   (as long as it is evaluated) has no impact other than to verify that the macro exists.
   `m5_\foo(` should not appear in literal text that is never to be evaluated as it would
   get undesirably sugared. (See <<quotes>> and <<prefix_escapes>> for syntax to avoid undesired sugaring.)

   NOTE: M5 may avoid applying this sugar for common macros from the M5 core library that are
   assumed to be defined.

   This `m5_foo(` syntax also enters "argument list context" (see <<contexts>>).


   [[variable_sugar]]
   === Variable Sugar

   `m5_Foo` (without a postceding `(`) is syntactic sugar for `m5_get(Foo)`. (See <<m_get>>.)
   `m5_Foo` should not appear in literal text that is never to be evaluated as it would
   get undesirably sugared. (For syntax to avoid undesired sugaring, see <<quotes>> and <<prefix_escapes>>.)


   [[prefix_escapes]]
   [reftext="Backslash Word Boundary"]
   === Backslash Word Boundary (`m5_\` and `\m5_`)

   As more convenient alternatives to quotes:

   - `m5_\foo` results in `m5_foo` without sugaring. This should be used in quoted, non-evaluated context when the literal
   string `m5_foo` is desired.
   - `\m5_foo` is shorthand for `['']m5_foo` to provide a word boundary, enabling M5 processing of `m5_foo` when preceded by a word.

   [[bodies]]
   === Multi-line Constructs: Blocks and Bodies

   ==== What are Bodies and Blocks?

   A "body" is a parameter or macro value that is to be be evaluated in the context of a caller.
   Macros, like <<m_if>> and <<m_loop>> have "immediate" body parameters. These bodies are to be evaluated
   by calls to these macros themselves. The final argument to a function or macro declaration
   is an "indirect" body argument. This body is to be evaluated, not by the declaration macro itself, but by the
   caller of the macro it declares.

   NOTE: Declaring macros that evaluate body arguments requires special consideration. See <<body_arguments>>.

   <<Code Blocks>> are convenient syntactic sugar constructs for multi-line body arguments formatted like code.

   <<Text blocks>> are syntactic sugar for specifying multi-line blocks of arbitrary text, indented with
   the code.

   ==== Macro Bodies

   A body argument can be provided as a quoted string of text:

    m5_if(m5_A > m5_B, ['['Yes, ']m5_A[' > ']m5_B'])   /// Might result in "Yes, 4 > 2".

   Note that the quoting of `['Yes, ']` prevents misinterpretation of the `,` as an argument separator
   as the body is evaluated.

   This syntax is fine for simple text substitutions, but it is essentially restricted to a single line
   which is unreadable for larger bodies that might define local variables, perform calculations,
   evaluate code conditionally, iterate in loops, call other functions, recurse, etc.

   [[code_blocks]]
   ==== Code Blocks

   M5 supports special multi-line syntactic sugar convenient for body arguments, called "code blocks". These look more
   like blocks of code in a traditional programming language. Aside from comments and whitespace, they
   contain only macro calls and variable elaborations ("statements"). The resulting text of the code block is constructed from the results
   of these macro calls.

   The code below is equivalent to the example above, expressed using a code body (and assuming it is
   itself called from within a code body).

    /Might result in "Yes, 4 > 2".
    ~if(m5_A > m5_B, [
       ~(['Yes, '])
       ~A
       ~([' > '])
       ~B
    ])

   The block begins with `[`, followed immediately by a newline. It ends with a line that begins with `]`,
   indented consistently with the beginning line. The above code block is "unscoped". A "scoped" code block
   uses, instead, `{` and `}`. Scopes are detailed in <<scope>>.

   The first non-blank line of the block determines the indentation of the block. Indentation uses spaces;
   tabs are discouraged, but must be used consistently if they are used. All non-blank lines at this level
   of indentation (after stripping M5 comments) begin a "statement".
   Lines with deeper indentation would continue a statement. A continuation line either begins a macro argument
   or is part of its own (nested) code block argument.

   Essentially, the body, when evaluated, results in the text produced by its statements, which are macros or
   variables, listed without their `m5_` prefix, or inline text.

   Specifically, statements can be:

   - Macro calls, such as `~if(m5_A > m5_B, ...)`.
   - Variable elaborations, such as `~A`.
   - Output statements, such as `~(['Yes, '])`.
   - Comments, such as `/A comment`.

   Statements that produce output (as all statements in the above example's code block do) must be preceded by `~`
   (and others may be). This simply helps to identify
   the source of code block ouput. The `~(...)` syntax produces the given text. A `m5_` prefix is implicit on statements.
   In the rare (and discouraged) event that a macro without this prefix is to be called, such as use of an `m4_`
   macro, using `~out(m4_...)` will do the trick.

   The earlier example behaves the same as:

    m5_out(m5_if(m5_A > m5_B, m5__block(['
       m5_out(['Yes, '])
       m5_out(m5_get(A))
       m5_out([' > '])
       m5_out(m5_get(B))
    ']))

   The (internal) `m5__block` macro evaluates its argument and results in any text captured by `m5_out`.  


   [[scope]]
   ==== Scoped Code Blocks

   Scoped <<Code Blocks>> are delimited by `{` / `}` quotes.
   Within a code block, variable declarations (e.g. made by <<m_var>>) are scoped. Their definitions are pushed by the declaration, and
   popped at the end of their scope. (See <<Macro Stacks>> regarding pushing and popping.)

   It is recommended that all indirect body arguments (see <<bodies>>), such as those of <<m_fn>> be scoped. Immediate body
   arguments (see <<bodies>>), such as those of <<m_if>>, are most often unscoped, but scope may be used to isolate the side
   effects of the block to explicit <<m_out_eval>> calls. Scoped and unscoped blocks are illustrated in the following example:

    fn(check, Cond, {
       if(m5_Cond, [
          warning(Check failed.)
       ])
    )}

   Declarations from outer scopes are visible in inner scopes. Similarly, declarations from calling scopes
   are visible in callee scopes, though functions should generally be written without any assumptions about the calling
   scope. Exceptions should be clearly documented/commented.

   NOTE: It is fine to redeclare a variable in the same scope. The redeclaration will override the first,
   and both definitions will be popped after evaluating the code block. Notably, a variable may be
   conditionally declared without any negative consequence on stack maintenance.

   By convention, scoped variables and macros use Pascal case, e.g. `MyVar`. (See <<Macro Naming Conventions>>.)


   [[text_blocks]]
   ==== Text Blocks

   "Text blocks" provide a syntax for multi-line quoted text that is indented with its surroundings.
   They are delimited similarly to code blocks, but use standard (`['` / `']` ) quotes. The openning quote
   must be followed by a newline and the closing quote must begin a new line that is indented consistently
   with the line beginning the block. Their indentation is defined by the first non-blank line in the block.
   All lines must contain at least this indentation (except the last). This fixed level of indentation
   and the beginning and ending newline are removed. For example:

    macro(copyright, ['['
       Copyright (c) 20xx
       All rights reserved.
    ']'])

   This is equivalent to:

    macro(copyright, ['['Copyright (c) 20xx']m5_nl['All rights reserved.']'])

   The text of the block is in source context, thus syntactic sugar is interpretted under the assumption
   that the text is to be evaluated. Text blocks that contain literal (quoted) text that is not evaluated
   should avoid entering argument list context with `m5_`, using quotes or `$` (if within a macro body), and it
   should be understood that vanishing comments would be removed.


   ==== Evaluate Blocks

   It can be convenient to form non-body arguments by evaluating code. Syntactic sugar is provided for
   this in the form of a `*` preceding the block open quote.

   For example, here a scoped evaluate code block is used to form an error message by searching for
   negative arguments:

    error(*{    /// like:  error(m5_eval({
       ~(['Arguments include negative values: '])
       var(Comma, [''])
       ~for(Value, ['$@'], [
          ~if(m5_Value < 0, [
             ~Comma
             set(Comma, [', '])
             ~Value
          ])
       ])
       ~(['.'])
    })


   [[block_labels]]
   [reftext="Block Labels"]
   ==== Block Labels: Escaping Blocks and Labeled Numbered Parameters

   Proper use of quotes can get a bit tedious, especially when it is necessary to escape out of several
   levels of nested quotes. It can improve maintainability, code clarity, and
   performance to make judicious use of block labels. Note, however, that *the need for block labels is
   rare* and is mostly replaced by mechanisms provided by <<Functions>>.

   Blocks can be labeled using syntax such as:

    macro(my_macro, ..., <sf>{
    })

   Labels can be used in two ways.

   - First, to escape out of a block, typically to generate text of the block.
   - Second, to specify the block associated with a numbered parameter.

   Both use cases are illustrated in the following example that attempts to declare a macro for parsing text.
   This macro declares a helper macro `ParseError` for reporting parse errors that can be
   used many times by `my_parser`.

    /Parse a block of text.
    macro(my_parser, {
       var(Text, ['$1'])  //']['/ Text to parse
       var(What, ['$2'])  //']['/ A description identifying what is begin parsed
       /Report a parse error, e.g. m5_ParseError(['unrecognized character'])
       macro(ParseError, {
          error(['Parsing of ']m5_What[' failed with: "$1"'])  /// !!! TWO MISTAKES !!!
       })
       ...
    })

   This code contains, potentially, two mistakes in the error message. First, `m5_What` will be
   substituted at the time of the call to `ParseError`. As long as `my_parser` does not
   modify the value of `What`, this is fine, but it might be preferred to expand `m5_What` in
   the definition itself to avoid this potential <<masking>> issue in case `What` is reused.

   Secondly, `${empty}1` will be substituted upon calling `my_parser`, not upon calling `ParseError`,
   and it will be substituted with a null string.

   The corrected example would use:

    macro(ParseError, <err>{
       error(['Parsing of ']<err>m5_What[' failed with: "$<err>1"'])  /']['// 2 Fixes!
    })

   This code corrects both issues:

   

   - `'{empty}]<err>m5_What[{empty}'`: This syntax acts in this case
   as `'{empty}]'{empty}]m5_nquote(1,m5_get(What))[{empty}'[{empty}'`, escaping enough
   levels of quoting to evaluate `m5_What` in the text of the `err` block and having the effect of
   using the definition of `m5_What` at the time of the macro definition. (The added level of quotes
   corresponds to the `{` / `}` block quotes which are sugar for `['` / `']`.)
   - `$<err>1`: This syntax associates `${empty}1` with the `err` block and is in this example
   equivalent to `'{empty}]'{empty}]m5_nquote_dollar(1,1)[{empty}'[{empty}'`.


   [[contexts]]
   === Contexts

   The various features of M5 apply in different contexts. This section summarizes the syntaxes
   that transition among contexts and the syntactic features available in each context. The
   context in which various features are supported is also summarized in <<Reference Card>>.
   Contexts can be nested, with the innermost context determining which features are available.

   The following file illustrates different contexts:

    Copyright (c) Joe Cool      /']['// source context
    m5_do([                     /']['// enter argument list context then code context
       var(Ver, 1.0)            /']['//     code context
       var(Banner, ['           /']['//     code context, enters source context
          Zap™ (v']m5_Ver[')    /']['//       text (escaping to code) context

       '])                      /']['//     exits source context
    ])                          /']['// exit code context then argument list context
    File version: m5_Ver        /']['// source context

   ==== Source Context

   Source context generally passes text through to the output. It is the default context and is
   also the context of text blocks.

   Features supported in source context are supported in all contexts. For text that is intended
   to be literal, caution must be taken to avoid inadvertent use of these syntaxes.
   (See <<Ensure No Impact>>.)

   The following are recognized in source context:

   - Vanishing comments
   - Macro calls
   - Variable instantiation
   - Pragmas

   ==== Text Context

   Text context is the default context entered by (block or non-block) `[{empty}'` quotes.

   In addition to the features of source context, the following are recognized in
   text context:

   - quotes are parsed and matched (see <<matching>>)

   ==== M5 Context

   Argument list context is entered from source and text contexts by, for example, `m5_foo(`. This context is exited by the corresponding `)`.
   In addition to text context features, the following are recognized in argument list context:

   - code and text blocks
   - parentheses are matched (see <<matching>>)

   ==== Code Context

   Code context is for <<Code Blocks>>, supporting syntactic sugar for formatting
   macro code more like programs.

   Code context is entered by `[`/`{` that end a line (after
   stripping vanishing comments) and is exited by the corresponding `]`/`}`
   beginning a line at matching indentation (also after
   stripping vanishing comments).

   In addition to argument list context features, the following are recognized in code context:

   - implicit `m5_` beginning lines
   - `~` allowing output (including, e.g. `~(hi)`, `~MyVar`, `~nl()`)
   - `/` comments


   [[pragmas]]
   [[checks]]
   === Syntax Checks and Pragmas

   [[indentation_checks]]
   ==== Indentation Checks

   M5 checks that indentation is consistent for code and text blocks.


   [[matching]]
   ==== Quote and Parenthesis Matching

   Parenthesis and quote matching is performed on the code after stripping comments.
   Quotes (including `[` / `]` and `{` / `}` quotes for code blocks) must be
   balanced.
   
   Within each level of quotes, parentheses must be balanced. Parentheses in
   source and text context are excluded from this check, thus requiring parentheses
   for macros and parentheses that appear unquoted within macro arguments to be
   balanced.

   Within a line, `'{empty}]` / `[{empty}'` quotes may be used (including nesting) to escape
   from and return to the same quoted context. This applies to contexts of all quote
   types, including code blocks, even though they are bound using different
   quote syntax. The context that is escaped from and returned to is the same
   context, thus parenthesis matching happens across the escaping. Thus, the
   parentheses on this code statement line are matching:

    ~hello('']]['<top>m5_Name'][['')
   
   Here are some other examples:

    m5_var(Expr, ['m5_calc(6 * (1 +']m5_Val['))'])   /']['// OK - both match
    /']['// Similar, across two lines:
    m5_var(Expr, ['m5_calc(6 * (1 +'])    /']['// Bad
    m5_append_var(Expr, m5_Val['))'])     /']['// Bad
    m5_var(Open, ['('])   /']['// OK - paren in text context
   
   See also, <<m_open_quote>>, <<m_close_quote>>, and
   `m5_pragma_[enable/disable]_paren_checks` in <<Pragmas>>.

   ==== Pragmas

   In certain cases quote and parenthesis checking gets in the way. It is possible to disable checking and control debug behavior using pragmas.
   Pragmas processing happens after M5 comments are stripped. The following strings are recognized as pragmas:

   * `where_am_i`: Prints the current quote context to STDERR.
   * `[enable/disable]_[paren/quote]_checks`: For disabling parenthesis/quote checking.
   * `[enable/disable]_sugar`: For disabling syntactic sugar (`m5_` and code/text blocks).
   * `[enable/disable]_debug`: Improves the readability of the file resulting from sugar processing, and continues processing after normally-fatal errors.
   * `[enable/disable]_verbose_checks`: Enables or disables verbose checking.

   Since the pragmas would pass through to the target file, pragmas are generally expressed using the following macro calls
   which elaborate to nothing:

   * `m5_pragma_{empty}where_am_i()`
   * `m5_pragma_[enable/disable]_{check}()`, where `{check}` is `paren_checks`, `quote_checks`, `sugar`, `debug`, or `verbose_checks`.


   === Literal Commas

   A comma (`,`) character appearing in source or text context is a "literal comma". It
   can never have special meaning as an argument separator even if used to construct a string
   that is evaluated as a macro call. A comma appearing in argument list or code context
   is a "non-literal comma". It is expected to be evaluated as a macro argument separator, though
   if never evaluated, it remains a `,` character and may pass through to the output.

   Generally, comma characters will behave as expected, but, caution must be taken in situations where
   macro calls are constructed, then evaluated. For these rare cases, let's consider a few examples.

   Here, the commas are argument separators:

    m5_foo(A, B, C)
   
   while those within quotes (in text context), here, are literal:

    m5_macro(MyList, ['A, B, C'])
   
   and `m5_foo(m5_MyList)` would receive a single parameter.

   It is possible to define `MyList` to contain argument-separator commas using the
   [[m_arg_comma]] variable, as:   /// <-- Create and document this variable.

    m5_macro(MyList, A\m5_arg_comma B\m5_arg_comma C)
   
   in which case `m5_foo(m5_MyList)` would receive three parameters.

   In this example:

    m5_macro(MyExpr, ['m5_foo(A, B, C)'])
   
   all commas are argument separator commas. This defines `m5_MyExpr()` to invoke `m5_foo`
   with three parameters.
   
   Below, however, `m5_\foo` is not recognized a macro call (though the `\` disappears), thus
   the commas separating `A`, `B`, and `C` are in text context and are literal (see <<prefix_escapes>>):

    m5_macro(MyExpr, ['m5_\foo(A, B, C)'])
   
   and `m5_MyExpr()` would invoke `m5_foo` with a single parameter. This has the same effect as:
   
    m5_macro(MyExpr, ['m5_foo(['A, B, C'])'])

   (aside from the fact that the latter would be sugared and thus the existence of `m5_foo` would be confirmed).

   == Coding Practices

   === Coding Conventions

   [[status]]
   === Status

   The variable <<v_status>> has a reserved usage. Some macros are defined to set <<v_status>>. A non-empty
   value indicates that the macro did not perform its duties to the fullest. Several `m5_if*` macros set non-empty
   status if they do not evaluate a body.

   Macros such as <<m_else>> and <<m_if_so>> take action based on <<v_status>>.

   Well-behaved macros set <<v_status>> always or never (and never is the assumption if no side effect is listed in a
   macro's documentation). Thus <<v_status>> is more like a return value than
   a sticky flag. Sticky behavior can be achieved using <<m_sticky_status>>. There is no support for try-catch-like
   error handling. In bodies of <<m_macro>> it may be necessary to explicitly save and restore status to avoid unintended
   side-effects on <<v_status>> from calls within the bodies. <<m_fn>> does this automatically. If <<v_status>> is checked, it is
   generally checked immediately after a call.


   === Functions

   All but the simplest of macros are most often declared using `m5_fn` and similar macros. These support a richer set of
   mechanisms for defining and passing parameter. While `m5_macro` is most often used with a one-line body definition,
   `m5_fn` is most often used with multi-line bodies as <<Scoped Code Blocks>>.

   Such `m5_fn` declarations using <<Scoped Code Blocks>> look and act like functions/procedures/subroutines/methods in a traditional
   programming language, and we often refer to them as "functions". Function calls pass arguments into parameters. Functions'
   code block bodies contain macro calls (statements) that define local variables, perform calculations, evaluate code conditionally,
   iterate in loops, call other functions, recurse, etc.

   Unlike typical programming languages, functions, like all macros, evaluate to text that substitutes for the calls.
   There is no mechanism to explicitly print to the standard output stream (though there
   are macros for printing to the standard error stream). Only a top-level call from the source code will
   implicitly echo to standard output.

   Functions are defined using: <<m_fn>> and <<m_lazy_fn>>.

   Declarations take the form:

    m5_fn(<name>, [<param-list>,] ['<body>'])

   A basic function declaration with a one-line body looks like:

    m5_fn(mul, val1, val2, ['m5_calc(m5_val1 * m5_val2)'])

   Or, equivalently, using a code block body:
      
    fn(mul, val1, val2, {
       ~calc(m5_val1 * m5_val2)
    })

   This `mul` function is called (in source context) like:

    m5_mul(3, 5)  //']['/ produces 15

   ==== Parameters

   ===== Parameters Types and Usage

   - *Numbered parameters*: Numbered parameters, as in <<m_macro>> (see <<Declaring Macros>>), can be referenced as `$1`, `$2`, etc. with
                            the same replacement behavior. However, they
                            are explicitly identified in the parameter list (see <<parameter_list>>).
                            Within the function body, similar to `['$3']`, <<m_fn_arg>> may also be used to access an argument. For example,
                            `m5_fn_arg(3)` evaluates to the literal third argument value.
   - *Special parameters*: As for <<m_macro>>, special parameters are supported. Note that: `${empty}@`, `${empty}*`, and `${empty}#` reflect only
                           numbered parameters. Also, `${empty}0` will not have the expected value, however `${empty}0__` can still be
                           used as a name prefix to localize names to this function. (See <<masking>>.) Similar to `${empty}@`, the <<m_fn_args>> macro
                           (or variable) also provides a quoted list of the numbered arguments.
                           Similar to `${empty}#`, the <<m_fn_arg_cnt>> macro also provides the number of numbered arguments.
   - *Named parameters*: These are available locally to the body as variables. They are not available to the <<Aftermath>> of
                         the function.

   [[parameter_list]]
   ===== The Parameter List

   The parameter list (`<param-list>`) is a list of zero or more `<param-spec>`{empty}s, where `<param-spec>` is:

   - A parameter specification of the form: `[?][[<number>]][[^]<name>][: <comment>]` (in this order), e.g. `?[2]^Name: the name of something`:
     * `<name>`:   Name of a named parameter.
     * `?`:        Specifies that the parameter is optional. Calls are checked to ensure that arguments are provided for all non-optional parameters
                   or are defined for inherited parameters. Non-optional parameters may
                   not follow optional ones.
     * `[<number>]`: Number of a numbered parameter. The first must be `[1]` and would correspond to `$1` and `m5_fn_arg(1)`, and so on.
                     `<number>` is verified to match the sequential ordering of numbered parameters. Numbered parameters may
                     also be named, in which case they can be accessed either way.
     * `^`:        Specifies that the parameter is inherited. It must also be named. Its definition is inherited from the context of the func definition.
                   If undefined, the empty `['']` value is provided and an error is reported unless the parameter is optional,
                   e.g. `?^<name>`. There is no corresponding argument in a call of this function. It is conventional to list
                   inherited parameters last (before the body) to maintain correspondence between the parameter
                   list of the definition and the argument list of a call.
     * `<comment>`: A description of the parameter. In addition to commenting the code, this can be extracted in
                   documentation./** See <<m_enable_doc>>.**/
   - `...`:        Listed after last numbered parameter to allow extra numbered arguments. Without this, extra arguments
                   result in an error (except for the single empty argument of e.g. `m5_foo()`. See <<fn_arguments>>.)

   ==== When To Use What Type of Parameter

   For nested declarations, the use of numbered parameters (`${empty}1`, `${empty}2`, ...) and special parameters
   (`${empty}@`, `${empty}*`, `${empty}#`, and `${empty}0`) can be extremely awkward.
   Nested declarations are declarations within the bodies of other declarations. Since nested bodies are part of outer bodies,
   numbered and special parameters within them would actually substitute based on the outer bodies. This can be prevented
   by generating the body with macros that produce the numbered parameter references, but this requires an unnatural and bug prone use of quotes.
   Therefore the use of functions with named parameters is preferred for inner macro declarations. Use of <<m_fn_args>> and <<m_fn_arg>> is
   also simpler than using special parameters. If parameters are named, these are helpful primarily
   to access `...` arguments or to pass argument lists to other functions.

   Additionally, and in summary:

   - *Numbered/special parameters*: These can be convenient to ensure substitution throughout the body without interference from
                        quotes. They can, however, be extremely awkward to use in nested definitions
                        as they would substitute with the arguments of the outer function/macro. Being unnamed,
                        readability is an issue, especially for large functions.
   - *Named parameters*: These act more like typical function arguments vs. text substitution. Since they are named, they
                        can improve readability. Unlike numbered parameters, they work perfectly well in functions
                        defined within other functions/macros. (Similarly, <<m_fn_args>> and <<m_fn_arg>> are useful
                        for nested declarations.) Macros will not evaluate within quoted strings, so typical use requires
                        unquoting, e.g. `['Arg1: ']m5_arg1['.']` vs. `['Arg1: $1.']`.
   - *Inherited parameters*: These provide a more natural, readable, and explicit mechanism for customizing a function to the
                        context in which it is defined. For example a function may define another function that is
                        customized to the parameters of the outer function.

   [[fn_arguments]]
   ==== Function Call Arguments

   Function calls must have arguments for all non-optional, non-inherited (`^`) parameters. Arguments are positional, so misaligning arguments
   is a common source of errors. There is checking, however, that required arguments are provided and that no extra arguments are given.
   `m5_foo()` is permitted for a function `foo` declared with no parameters, though it is passed one emtpy parameter.
   (`m5_call(foo)` might be preferred.)

   ==== Function Arguments Example

   In argument list context, function `foo` is declared below to display its parameters.

    /Context:
    var(Inherit2, two)
    /Define foo:
    fn(foo, Param1, ?[1]Param2: an optional parameter,
            ?^Inherit1, [2]^Inherit2, ..., {
       ~nl(Param1: m5_Param1)
       ~nl(Param2: m5_Param2)
       ~nl(Inherit1: m5_Inherit1)
       ~nl(Inherit2: m5_Inherit2)
       ~nl(['numbered args: $@'])
    })

   And it can be called (again, in argument list context):

    /Call foo:
    foo(arg1, arg2, extra1, extra2)

   And this expands to:

    Param1: arg1
    Param2: arg2
    Inherit1:
    Inherit2: two
    numbered args: ['arg2'],['two'],['extra1'],['extra2']

   ==== Aftermath

   It is possible for a function to make assignments (and, actually do anything) in the calling scope.
   This can be done using <<m_on_return>> or <<m_return_status>>.

   This is important for:

   - passing arguments by reference
   - returning status
   - evaluating body arguments
   - tail recursion

   Each of these is discussed in its own section, next.


   ==== Passing Arguments by Reference

   Functions can pass variables by reference and make assignments to the referenced
   variables upon returning from the function. For example:

    fn(update, FooRef, {
       var(Value, ['updated value'])
       on_return(set, m5_FooRef, m5_Value)
    }
    set(Foo, ['xxx'])
    update(Foo)
    ~Foo   /// Results in "updated value".

   A similar function could be defined to declare a referenced variable by using `var` instead of `set`.

   The use of <<m_on_return>> avoids the potential masking issue that would result from:

    update(Value)


   ==== Returning Status

   A function's <<v_status>> should be returned via the function's aftermath, using <<m_return_status>>, e.g.

    fn(my_fn, Val, {
       if(m5_Val > 10, [''])
       return_status(m5_status)   /// Return the status from the if statement.
    })

   Functions automatically restore <<v_status>> after body evaluation to its value prior to body evaluation, so
   the evaluation of the body has no impact on <<v_status>>. Aftermath is evaluated after this.
   It is fine to call <<m_return_status>> multiple times. Only the last call will have a visible effect.


   [[body_arguments]]
   ==== Functions with Body Arguments

   The example below illustrates a function `if_neg` that takes an argument that is a body to evaluate.
   The body is defined in a calling function, e.g. `my_fn` on lines 15-16. Such a body is expected to evaluate
   in the context of the calling function, `my_fn`. Its assignment of `Neg`, on line 15, should be an assignment of
   its own local `Neg`, declared on line 12. Its side effects from <<m_return_status>> on
   line 15 should be side effects of `my_fn`.

   If the body is evaluated inside the function body, its side effects would be side effects of `if_neg`,
   not `my_fn`. The body should instead be evaluated as aftermath, using <<m_on_return>>, as on line 6.

   Note that <<m_return_status>> is called after evaluating `m5_Body`. Both <<m_on_return>> and <<m_return_status>>
   add to the <<Aftermath>> of the function, and <<v_status>> must be set after evaluating the body (which
   could affect <<v_status>>).

   Example of a body argument.

     1: // Evaluate a body if a value is negative.
     2: fn(if_neg, Value, Body, {
     3:    var(Neg, m5_calc(Value < 0))
     4:    ~if(Neg, [
     5:       /~eval(m5_Body)    /// Incorrect!!!
     6:       on_return(Body)    /// Correct.
     7:    ])
     8:    return_status(if(Neg, [''], else))
     9: })
    10: 
    11: fn(my_fn, {
    12:    var(Neg, [''])
    13:    return_status(['pos'])
    14:    ~if_neg(1, [
    15:       return_status(['neg'])
    16:       set(Neg, ['-'])
    17:    ])
    18:    ...
    19: })

   Since <<m_macro>> does not support <<Aftermath>>, it is not recommended to use <<m_macro>> with a body argument.


   ==== Tail Recursion

   Recursive calls tend to grow the stack significantly, and this can result in an error (see <<v_recursion_limit>>) as well
   inefficiency. When recursion is the last act of the function ("tail recursion"), the recursion can be performed in
   aftermath to avoid growing the stack. For example:

    fn(my_fn, First, ..., {
       ...
       ~unless(m5_Done, [
          ...
          on_return(my_fn\m5_comma_args())
       ])
       ...
    })


   /** WIP
   === Contexts: Namespaces, and Libraries

   ==== Contexts

   The context of a macro comes in three types:

   - Universal: Universal macro names are the same for any M5 program. These can be called directly, prefixed
   with `m5_`. They can be:
   - Built-in: These are defined by the M5 library.
   - External: These are only defined if explicitly included.
   - Namespaced: Namespaces are used to avoid name conflicts between third-party libraries and between different
   versions of the same library. Namespaces are local to a library or application, and may exist in a hierarchy.
   The same macro may exist in multiple namespaces of multiple libraries, and its definition is shared.
   Namespaced macros are called via `m5_my(...)`.
   - Scoped: Declarations made within a <<scope>> are local to that scope. Naming conventions avoid
   name conflicts with the other context types.


   ==== Macro Naming Conventions

   To avoid <<masking>> issues, naming conventions divide the namespace in two styles:

   - Lower case with underscores, e.g.: `m5_builtin_macro`
   - Pascal case, e.g. `m5_MyVarName`

   Names using lowercase with underscores: universal, namespaces, namespaced

   Names using Pascal case: scoped macros (variables, functions, and traditional macros)

   In both cases, names must be composed of ASCII characters `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, and `_`, and the first character must be alphabetic.

   Libraries may define private macros using double underscore (`__`). A non-private macro in a universal library reserves
   its own name in the universal namespace and also private names beginning with that name and `__`.
   To maximize the ability of third-party libraries to share a namespace with other libraries, macros in third-party
   libraries that are helpers for other macros should use the name of the associated macro before the `__`.

   [[masking]]
   ==== Variable Masking

   Variable "masking" is an issue that can arise when a macro has side effects determined by its arguments.
   For example, an argument might specify the name of a variable to assign, or an argument might provide a body to
   evaluate that could declare or assign arbitrary variables. If the macro declares a local variable,
   and the side effect updates a variable by the same name, the local variable may inadvertently be the
   one that is updated by the side effect. This issue is addressed differently depending
   how the macro is defined. Note that using function <<Aftermath>> is the preferred method, but all
   options are listed here for completeness:

   * Functions: Set variables using <<Aftermath>>. Using functions for variable-setting macros is preferred.
   * Macros declaring their body using a code block: Set variable using <<m_out_eval>>.
   * Macros declaring their body using a string: Push/pop local variables named using `${empty}0__` prefix.

         or to the end of the
         string if `Length` is omitted or exceeds the string length. The first character of the string has index 0.
         The result is empty if there is an error parsing `From` or `Length`, if `From` is beyond the end of the string,
         or if `Length` is negative.
         
         Extracting substrings from strings with quotes is dangerous as it can lead to imbalanced quoting.
         If the resulting string would contain any quotes, an error is reported suggesting the use of `dequote` and `requote`
         and the resulting string has its quotes replaced by control characters.
         
         Extracting substrings from UTF-8 strings (supporting unicode characters) is also dangerous. M5
         treats characters as bytes and UTF-8 characters can use multiple bytes, so substrings can split
         UTF-8 characters. Such split UTF-8 characters will result in bytes/M5-characters that have no
         special treatment in M5. They can be rejoined to reform valid UTF-8 strings.
         
         When evaluating substrings, care must be taken with `,`, `(`, and `)` because of their meaning in argument parsing.

      ==== Regular Expressions

      ['
         Regular expressions in M5 use the same regular expression syntax as GNU Emacs. (See
         https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Regexps.html[GNU Emacs Regular Expressions].)
         This syntax is similar to BRE, Basic Regular Expressions in POSIX and is regrettably rather limited.
         Extended Regular Expressions are not supported.

         `Replacement` provides the output text. It may contain references to subexpressions of `Regex` to expand
         in the output. In `Replacement`, `\n` references the nth parenthesized subexpression of `Regexp`, up to nine
         subexpressions, while `\&` refers to the text of the entire regular expression matched. For all other
         characters, a preceding `\` treats the character literally.
         O: If `Replacement` is omitted, the index of the first match of `Regexp` in `String` is produced (where the
         first character in the string has an index of 0), or -1 is produced if there is no match.

      ==== Arithmetic Macros
      
      m5_DocFn(calc, ['
         D: Calculate an expression.
         Calculations are done with 32-bit signed integers. Overflow silently results in wraparound.
         A warning is issued if division by zero is attempted, or if the expression could not be parsed.
         Expressions can contain the following operators, listed in order of decreasing precedence.

         - `()`: For grouping subexpressions
         - `+`, `-`, `~`, `!`: Unary plus and minus, and bitwise and logical negation
         - `**`: Exponentiation (exponent must be non-negative, and at least one argument must be non-zero)
         - `*`, `%`: Multiplication, division, and modulo
         - `+ -`: Addition and subtraction
         - `<<`, `>>`: Shift left or right (for shift amounts > 32, the amount is implicitly ANDed with `0x1f`)
         - `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`: Relational operators
         - `==`, `!=`: Equality operators
         - `&`: Bitwise AND
         - `^`: Bitwise XOR (exclusive or)
         - `\|`: Bitwise OR
         - `&&`: Logical AND
         - `\|\|`: Logical OR

         All binary operators, except exponentiation, are left-associative. Exponentiation is right-associative.
         
         Immediate values in `Expr` may be expressed in any radix (aka base) from 1 to 36 using prefixes as follows:
         
         - (none): Decimal (base 10)
         - `0`: Octal (base 8)
         - `0x`: hexadecimal (base 16)
         - `0b`: binary (base 2)
         - `0r:`, where `r` is the radix in decimal: Base `r`.
         
         Digits are `0`, `1`, `2`, …, `9`, `a`, `b` … `z`. Lower and upper case letters can be used
         interchangeably in numbers and prefixes. For radix 1, leading zeros are ignored, and all remaining
         digits must be `1`.

         For the relational operators, a true relation returns 1, and a false relation return 0.
         O: the calculated value of the expression in the given `Radix`; the value is zero-extended as requested by `Width`; values may

      The contexts listed under the "Contexts" column of <<syntax_table>> are described in <<Contexts>>. "Yes" in the
      "Must Be Evaluated" column indicates that the syntax should not pass through to the output without being evaluated.
      Doing so may result in an error or unexpected output text.
      
      Additionally, text and code block syntax is recognized when special quotes are opened at the end of a line or closed
      at the beginning of a line. See <<Code Blocks>>. For example:

       /Report error.
       error(*<blk>{
          ~(['Something went wrong!'])
       })

      All syntax in <<block_syntax>> must be evaluated (strictly, must not be unevaluated).

      Though not essential, block labels can be used to improve maintainability and performance in extreme cases.

      Many macros accept arguments with syntaxes of their own, defined in the macro definition. Functions, for example are fundamental. See <<Functions>>.

      /**
      == Thoughts for M6
      
      === Special Characters
      
      If only we could reserve a few characters specifically for M5 (for "m5_", quotes, and commas especially,
      and parentheses would be nice too). Alas, there is no standard, global way to type non-ascii characters.

      === Literal vs. Source Quotes
      
      It might be nice to have different flavors of quotes for literal text vs. text that is to be evaluated (source).
      Literal text would not parse for macros and quotes other than the corresponding end quote.
      We could add checking that the final output does not contain any source strings and that literals are
      not evaluated. This would be problematic, though in that it requires adding characters to the strings
      while would throw off things like string length. It is difficult, also, to add runtime checks against
      things like contatenating literals with source strings. So this requires a new (non-M4-based) implementation.
